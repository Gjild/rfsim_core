    An immutable container for the complete state of a single simulation run.

    This object represents the "what" of the simulationâ€”the complete, unambiguous
    source of truth for all inputs (the circuit, the frequencies) and shared
    resources (the cache). It is passed to the stateless SimulationEngine, which
    operates on it.

    Its immutability, enforced by `frozen=True`, is a powerful feature that
    guarantees a simulation's initial conditions cannot be altered mid-execution.
    This fulfills a key aspect of the "Correctness by Construction" mandate by
    eliminating an entire class of potential side-effect bugs.
